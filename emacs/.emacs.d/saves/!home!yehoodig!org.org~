** MIDI Music
*** What is MIDI
MIDI is a standard for transmitting information about music.  The standard has 16 channels.  .mid files first tell the player what instruments to assign to each MIDI channel, and then give a channel, and a note and duration to be played on that channel.  The sound each instrument produces is defined by patches, either in the rom of a synth box, like the MT-32, SC-55 or as a soundfont. 
**** MT-32
The MT-32 kinda sorta predates MIDI.  It will only accept messages on channels 2-9.  For "General MIDI" applications you would need an SC-55 or later, or a software solution.
*** Linux
- First, install pmidi
  - pmidi -l lists installed midi devices
  - Easiest way:
	 - qtsynth :: a gui for fluidsynth (a synth that takes soundfonts)
  - Hard way: install timidity++ 
** launchy script
There are several systems that games (or for that matter old software) run through.  I would like a fairly robust system that is agnostic to these things so that I don't have to remember specific commands.

  - [X] List availiable commands
- [ ] wine
  - [ ] List availiable commands
- [ ] native

** Game Specific info
*** Kings Quest VI
	 - VGA320.DRV is bad, video stutters in cutscenes
		- Fix: Do the large install and take the VGA320.DRV from the GabrielKnight1Demo(GKDEMO).zip file
** Creating a CD image ISO images will generally be fine.  However, there are cases where they won't be. - Mixed Mode CDs (With audio tracks) - Some CDs have multiple filesystems living side by side.  This can confuse the utilities, so in such a case, you may need to rip the CD as a CUE/BIN *** ISO Images
	 1. use isoinfo -d -i /dev/cdrom to determine blocksize and count  
	 2. dd if=/dev/:cdrom bs=blocksize count=count of=/name/of/iso.iso

	 This is not what you need to do to get an image of a mixed mode cd, for that, use cdrdao. 
	 I guess the mounted dev is just one item in the device.
*** CUE/BIN (Mixed Mode CD's)
	Create an image using cdrdao with driver option specified and then convert toc file usiong toc2cue
		1. If the cd was automounted when inserted, you need to unmount it with:
			- umount /dev/cdrom
	   2. Rip with cdrdao using the following command (driver option is important!): [fn:1]
			- linux :: cdrdao read-cd --datafile image.bin --driver generic-mmc:0x20000 --device /dev/cdrom --read-raw image.toc
         - Mac :: cdrdao read-cd --datafile image.bin --driver generic-mmc:0x20000 --device IODVDServices/0 --read-raw image.toc
	   3. toc2cue image.toc image.cue
	Properties of the image
	‚ÅÉ Mountable in DOSBox


[fn:1] These cue/bin images CANNOT be mounted by VirtualBox, and VirtualCD-RW will only show the audio tracks.
** DOSBox Specific info
- DOSBox can use compressed CUE/BIN images if the audio tracks are in OGG format (Will not work with mp3)
  1. Rip the bin to ISO/WAVs
  2. Compress the tracks to ogg format
  3. Modify the cue file
* Shell commands to remember
- efibootmgr :: edit the boot order for UEFI
- timedatectl :: manages how the hardware clock is handled.  Use "timedatectl set-local-rtc 1" to syncronize with Windows on a dual boot system.
